_My path since 2014._

I am looking for full-time roles as machine learning engineer or data-scientist starting June 2022. I am eager to apply my skills in developing data-driven geospatial models to solve your problems! 

My skills include- 

1. Developing physics-guided deep learning models (marrying mechanistic principles with empirical methods)
2. Geospatial analytics including building large data pipelines
3. Hypothesis testing (including causal inference) 

Interested or know anyone who might be interested in hiring me? [Please email me.](mailto:kkrao@stanford.edu)

# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. 

I develop physics-assisted machine learning algorithms to measure forest health (how wet or dry the forests are) using remote sensing. I work in the <a href="https://koningslab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Group</a> with Prof. Alexandra Konings. I got my bachleors in Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and my masters in Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology at Stanford University. During my bachelors and masters, I worked on several  independent studies which convinced me about the endless possibilities of impact-based research. My quest to develop technologies to measure forest health and help quantify climate change impacts on ecosystems is derived from that conviction.

### Research

My research interests include understanding forest hydraulic health dynamics towards charecterizing wildfire risk and drought impacts on vegetation. To do so, I work across several scales - from plot-scale measurements to landscape-scale estimations.  To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://krishnakrao.github.io/publications/) or [talks](https://krishnakrao.github.io/talks/). 

### Skills

Since my research involves developing data-driven approaches, where required, I apply machine learning and deep learning. While learning skills related to data science in my coursework, I worked on several projects to gain hands-on experience. The [projects tab](https://krishnakrao.github.io/projects/) includes such side projects.

### Job

For about 2 years between my bachelors and masters, I was a Wireline Field Engineer at Schlumberger in Northeast India. There, I designed, executed and delivered several projects for reservoir characterization (measuring quantity and quality of hydrocarbon payzones) and intervention (e.g., increase wellbore flow, plug old boreholes, etc.)

### Hobbies

My hobbies include bicycle touring, and triathlons. I am passionate about them and devote my entire free time to them. You can read more about my hobbies on the [blog section](https://krishnakrao.github.io/blog/).
