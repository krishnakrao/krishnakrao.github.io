<!--- For more details about my education and professional experience, view my [CV](https://krishnakrao.github.io/cv/). -->

### Research

My research interests include understanding forest hydraulic health dynamics towards charecterizing wildfire risk and drought impacts on vegetation. To do so, I work across several scales - from plot-scale measurements to landscape-scale estimations.  To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://krishnakrao.github.io/publications/) or [talks](https://krishnakrao.github.io/talks/). 

### Skills

Since my research involves developing data-driven approaches, where required, I apply machine learning and deep learning. While learning skills related to data science in my coursework, I worked on several projects to gain hands-on experience. The [projects tab](https://krishnakrao.github.io/projects/) includes such side projects.

### Job

For about 2 years between my bachelors and masters, I was a Wireline Field Engineer at Schlumberger in Northeast India. There, I designed, executed and delivered several projects for reservoir characterization (measuring quantity and quality of hydrocarbon payzones) and intervention (e.g., increase wellbore flow, plug old boreholes, etc.)

### Hobbies

My hobbies include bicycle touring, and triathlons. I am passionate about them and devote my entire free time to them. You can read more about my hobbies on the [blog section](https://krishnakrao.github.io/blog/).
